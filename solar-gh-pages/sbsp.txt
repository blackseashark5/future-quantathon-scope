 - No greenhouse gas emmitted
 - "Solar energy is plentiful, clean, and for all practical purposes provides a limitless source of power." - LLNL

Why Space Based? / Why not ground?
 - Not always sunny (clouds + night)
 - Low energy density on ground?
 - Remote bases and villages could get power without much ground x

Laser:
 - 1 MW of Power per satellite
 - Low Earth Ordbit
 - 3600 m2 or > half football field for collector, focused into 12m2
pro
 - 1000 fold reduced overall size requirements


Microwave:
pro
 - Good transmition in cloud cover
 - transmitted through air at intensity no greater than midday sun.

cons
 - Huge sie of microwave Rectenna on earth
